A complete chess game written in python using the PyGame module. There is a chess engine built in written with basic AI principles. To minimize waiting time, the engine uses depth limited search on the game tree, as well as a custom evaluation function created by myself. It plays at around a 1600 rating  
(<em> enough to beat an above-average player </em> ).
