A replica of the famous arcade game, pac man. A single player option is available, but the focus of this project was to show off the various search algorithms. Depending on the puzzel at hand, pacman can use BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy or A\* search if its a searching problem, or he can use minimax or expectimax if he is facing an adversarial.
